#Rock Paper & Scissors
This is a simple, browser-based implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

The game is played over five rounds against the computer. It utilizes JavaScript functions to handle user input via prompt(), generate the computer's randomized choice, determine the winner of each round, and track the scores. The final results and round-by-round play are logged directly to the browser's Developer Console.
